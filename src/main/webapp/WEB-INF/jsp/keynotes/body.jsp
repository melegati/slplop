			<h3>QA to AQ: Shifting from Quality Assurance to Agile Quality</h3>
			<h4>Joseph Yoder</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p>As organizations transition to agile processes, Quality Assurance (QA) activities and roles need to evolve. 
			Traditionally, QA activities occur late in the process, after the software is fully functioning. As a consequence, 
			QA departments have been "quality gatekeepers" rather than actively engaged in the ongoing development and 
			delivery of quality software. Agile teams incrementally deliver working software. Incremental delivery provides 
			an opportunity to engage in QA activities much earlier, ensuring that both functionality and important system 
			qualities are addressed just in time, rather than too late. Agile teams embrace a "whole team" approach. Even though 
			special skills may be required to perform certain development and Quality Assurance tasks, everyone on the team is 
			focused on the delivery of quality software.</p>
		
			<b>Description:</b>
			<p>Prioritizing and implementing necessary functionality keeps an agile project moving forward. But in a 
			sprint to deliver features, agile teams can overlook software qualities. By focusing only on functionality, 
			the security, scalability, performance, and reliability concerns can get shoved aside or wistfully imagined 
			as emerging along with the architecture. But what if you need to pay more attention to system qualities? How 
			can you interject quality specification, design, and testing efforts into your project and be more agile about 
			it? This talk introduces agile techniques and patterns of practices that support the definition and delivery 
			of system qualities.</p>
			<p>I will show how to write Quality Scenarios in an Agile manner that emphasize architecture capabilities such 
			as usability, security, performance, scalability, internationalization, availability, accessibility and the like. 
			I will also address the when, where, and how on Quality Scenarios. This will include how to identify, profile, and 
			outline the relevant quality characteristics.</p>

			<h3>Twenty years of Design Patterns</h3>
			<h4>Ralph E. Johnson</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p>"Design Patterns", by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides,
			was released in October, 1994. It has continued to sell for 20 years and has had
			a big impact.  Twenty years after it came out, some of the patterns
			continue to be important, some less important. New patterns have arisen that have
			displaced some of the older patterns.  There are common ways that the patterns
			are misused.  Ralph Johnson will talk about what he has learned about
			the patterns since the book was published.</p>
			
			<b>Biography:</b>
			<p>Ralph Johnson is one of four coauthors of "Design Patterns" and the leader
			of the group that built the first refactoring tool, the Smalltalk Refactoring Browser.
			He is still working on patterns and program transformation, though the spotlight
			has shifted off of basic object-oriented design to topics like parallel programming
			and innovative ways of making business software.</p>
			<p>He joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
			in 1985, and retired recently to work on a system for automating business transactions.</p>

			<h3>Challenges and Opportunities for Software Patterns in the Internet of Things Era</h3>
			<h4>Rossana M. C. Andrade</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p>Internet of things considers everything with intelligence connected in the web: people, 
			devices, cloud, services and other "things".  This paradigm brings new perspectives to research 
			since puts together sensors, actuators, embedded systems, ubiquitous systems, big data, 
			security, and so on. On the other hand, software patterns have been reused and proven to be 
			good solutions for improving quality. Then, in this talk, both paradigms will be discussed in 
			an attempt to integrate them and to come up with new challenges and opportunities for research.</p>
			<b>Biography:</b>
			<p>Rossana M. C. Andrade is an Associate Professor at Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza, 
			Brazil, in the Department of Computer Science. She received her Ph.D from School of Information 
			Technology and Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Canada, in May 2001. In her thesis, 
			she works on software patterns for telecommunications and since then she has been involved
			with the Brazilian pattern community. Andrade does research in the areas of computer networks 
			and software engineering. Specifically, she is working on alternative solutions to specify and 
			validate ubiquitous systems as well as to reuse good solutions for their development and to increase 
			their reliability with the application of formal techniques.</p>

			<h3>Pattern Language 3.0: A New Generation of Pattern Languages</h3>
			<h4>Takashi Iba</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p>Since the late 1990s, pattern languages began to be applied to an increasing range
			of fields to encompass creative human actions such as education and innovation. To distinguish 
			this new generation of  pattern languages that describe patterns for creative human actions, 
			Iba have named it  "Pattern Language 3.0." As pattern language domains have expanded, so have 
			its uses. Pattern languages  have been used as media for dialogue to allow the exchange of 
			personal experiences. In this talk, I present the idea of Pattern Language 3.0, and show 
			examples of pattern languages as well as new uses for them.</p>
			<b>Biography:</b>
			<p>Takashi Iba, a trans-disciplinary researcher, creator, and writer, explores the nature
			of creativity and works to build media to nurture it. He is an associate professor at the 
			Faculty of Policy Management and the Graduate School of Media and Governance 
			of Keio University, Japan. With collaborate with his students, Dr. Iba has created 
			many pattern languages concerning human actions, including learning, presentations, 
			collaboration, education, entrepreneurship, and beauty. He received a Ph.D. in Media 
			and Governance from Keio University in 2003, and continued as a visiting scholar at the 
			MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, 2009-2010. He has authored many academic 
			books such as the bestselling "Introduction to Complex Systems: An Adventure to 
			the Frontier of Knowledge" (1998, in Japanese), and many others including "Pattern 
			Languages" (2013, in Japanese), "Presentation Patterns" (2013, in Japanese, received 
			the GOOD DESIGN AWARD 2013), and "Social Systems Theory" (2011, in Japanese).</p>
