		<div class="panel-body">
			
			<p>Paper submissions may include short papers containing one or more patterns, longer pattern languages 
			or sequences, or works-in-progress by writers wishing to get in-depth shepherding by an experienced author 
			at the conference. Patterns and pattern languages on other topics, essays on patterns, and visions for 
			the future are encouraged.</p>

			<p>In addition, you may submit proposals for free-format discussion groups or workshops bringing together
			people interested in a hot topic related to patterns or proven practices-with a duration about two hours. 
			Non-conventional formats are welcome.</p>

			<h2>THE CONFERENCE</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">	
			<p>Software developers have long observed that certain patterns recur and endure across different
			applications and systems. Patterns represent an effort to catalog and better communicate
			knowledge, providing handbooks of proven solutions to common problems. The purpose of
			SugarLoafPLoP is to discuss patterns on all aspects of software, including design and
			programming, software architecture, user interface design, domain modeling, software processes,
			project management, and more.</p>

			<p>SugarLoafPLoP brings together researchers, educators, and practitioners whose interests span a
			remarkably broad range of topics and who share an interest in exploring the power of the pattern
			form. SugarLoafPLoP invites you to add your expertise to the growing corpus of patterns.
			SugarLoafPLoP focuses on improving the expression of patterns. You will have the opportunity to
			refine and extend your patterns with the help from knowledgeable and sympathetic fellow pattern
			enthusiasts. You will also be able to discuss applications of patterns in industry and academia.</p>
			
			<p>Highlights of the conference include tutorials, invited speakers, workshops, and games, all held in
			an awesome beach in Ilha Bela, Brazil, an area of great natural beauty. This year, celebrating the
			10th edition of the conference, we have the confirmed presence of Ralph Johnson, one of the Gang
			of Four, and Joseph Yoder.</p>

			<p>The SugarLoafPLoP program is divided in two different tracks:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Writers' Workshop (WW) - papers that document patterns and pattern languages will be
			workshopped in the traditional PLoP format.</li>
			
			<li>Pattern Applications (PA) - papers that explore the use and application of patterns, such as
			using patterns in industry and academia, tools for using patterns, evaluation of productivity
			when using patterns, teaching and consulting with patterns, and so on. Both practitioners
			from the software industry and academics are invited to submit to this track.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>PAPER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>The core of SugarLoafPLoP is the Writers' Workshop, where authors work together to improve
			their papers. Before papers are accepted for a Writers' Workshop, they are shepherded.
			Shepherding is an iterative process, where an experienced author discusses the submission with its
			authors to refine the paper prior to the conference. All submissions are peer-reviewed after
			shepherding.</p>
			
			<p>Following shepherding, papers may be accepted directly into a Writers' Workshop or alternatively,
			into a Writing Group. Writing Group papers will receive additional face­to­face shepherding at the
			conference. Writing Group papers reaching a required standard will be considered for workshop
			review on the final day of the conference.</p>
			
			<p>There is a three stage submission process for the conference:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Initial submissions are assessed for suitability. Papers judged suitable are assigned a
			shepherd who will help its authors improve the paper.</li>
			
			<li>Authors are expected to submit a second draft part way through the shepherding process.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>After shepherding, each paper will be assessed for quality and its authors' willingness to
			accept feedback. This review will determine whether a paper is accepted to the conference.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Authors and shepherds are expected to continue until the final drafts are due.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>To submit your paper, please visit: <a href="http://hillside.net/sugarloafplop/submission">http://hillside.net/sugarloafplop/submission</a>. The
			final version of the paper should be submitted in the PDF format (produced on a highÂ­resolution
			output device) on letter paper size (8 1/2" x 11") following the ACM single column format. Initial
			submissions that don't follow the format will be accepted, but the last version should follow the
			templates to be published on the ACM library. ACM single column templates are available in
			Word and LaTex:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Single column format Word template: <a href="http://www.hillside.net/plop/2014/ACM-single-column-plop-word.zip">Single Column Template</a></li>
				<li>Single column format TeX template: <a href="http://www.hillside.net/plop/2014/ACM-single-column-plop-tex.zip">TeX Template</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>At least one of the authors of accepted papers are expected to register for the conference before the
			close of early­bird registration. Failure to do so may result in acceptance being withdrawn.
			The SugarLoafPLoP proceedings are published after the conference through the ACM Digital
			Library. Papers published at writer's workshop track at this conference are qualified for submission
			to the new journal "Transactions on Pattern Languages of Programming" published by Springer.
